# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this project is to set up a dynamic website for UFO enthusiast. So that they may be able to filter through multiple criteria to look up data on UFO sighting. 

## Results:
The website is functional you can enter multiple criteria as shown in the following images. [Image 1](https://github.com/ElizMishina/UFOs/blob/master/static/images/basic_page.png) is the basic website, [Image 2](https://github.com/ElizMishina/UFOs/blob/master/static/images/organ.png) is one with one criteria entered, "or" for Organ, [Image 3](https://github.com/ElizMishina/UFOs/blob/master/static/images/organ.png) is with two criteria entered, "or" for Organ and date being 01/01/2010.

## Summary:
One issue that I noticed with this website is if you do not enter the word absolutely correctly into the search bar it will not find it. For example as shown [here]( https://github.com/ElizMishina/UFOs/blob/master/static/images/ca.png) this is what happens when I enter “ca” , where as [here]( https://github.com/ElizMishina/UFOs/blob/master/static/images/ca_capital.png) this is what happens when I enter “CA”.

Something that might be great for further development. When clicking off the webpage a doing task elsewhere the criteria clear, so if someone is toggling it issues crop up.
Another thing that might be great for further development would be to give a list instead of a data entry from some of the options, because at the moment the only country in this data set is US, so instead of having to type in a state initial giving them as options instead will make it easier for people to look up.
